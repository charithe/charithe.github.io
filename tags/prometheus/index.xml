      <description>Hystrix is a well-known fault tolerance library for distributed systems. If your application needs to interact with remote systems (or even micro-services running in the same data center), Hystrix will provide latency-sensitive routing, retries, request coalescing, circuit breakers and many more fault-tolerance features out of the box. I cannot do much justice to Hystrix in this short brain dump but there are many great articles and presentations around the web that are well worth perusing.</description>
